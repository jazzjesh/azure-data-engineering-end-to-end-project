The following SQL views are consumed in Power BI:

- `gold.customers`
- `gold.products`
- `gold.sales`
- Additional Star Schema tables (DimDate, DimCustomer, DimProduct, FactSales)

Power BI does **not** import data files directly; instead, it queries Gold data using Synapse SQL Views.

## 2️⃣ Data Model Used in Power BI

The model follows a clean **Star Schema** optimized for analytics.

### ⭐ Fact Table
**FactSales**
- Order-level transaction data
- Linked to Product, Customer, and Date dimensions
- Fields include:
  - SalesOrderID  
  - OrderDateKey  
  - CustomerID  
  - ProductID  
  - Quantity  
  - UnitPrice  
  - TotalAmount  

### ⭐ Dimension Tables
- **DimCustomer**
- **DimProduct**
- **DimDate**

### 🔗 Relationships
- FactSales → DimCustomer (`CustomerID`)
- FactSales → DimProduct (`ProductID`)
- FactSales → DimDate (`OrderDateKey`)

This ensures:
- High performance  
- Accurate aggregations  
- Clean and expressive visuals
